# Myalgic-Encephalomyelitis-Chronic-Fatigue-Syndrome-Microbiome-Study

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, disabling disease marked by extreme fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and post-exertional malaise. Diagnosis is challenging due to symptom overlap with other conditions and the absence of clear biomarkers, leading to frequent misdiagnosis. Recent research suggests a connection between ME/CFS and long COVID, with both involving immune and metabolic dysfunction. One emerging area of interest is the gut-brain axis, where gut microbiome imbalances may influence neurological and immune pathways. This project analyzes microbiome data from fecal samples of ME/CFS patients to identify bacterial strains that may be linked to symptom development or severity.
